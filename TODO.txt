 Features

 * Allow users to specify where preference files are stored. (Is this possible
   with FLTK?)
 * Add support for multiple preference files; e.g., site-wide, group, per-user
   preferences.
 * Add an option to reset preferences to default values. Possibly extend this
   to "preference profiles", where the default values are just one of many
   profiles the user can choose from.
 * Direct suport for ffmpeg? (It's currently only used indirectly through
   libquicktime.)
 * Add buttons or some other widget to the file browser for quickly navigating
   shortcuts.
 * Add support for additional formats like R3D and JPEG2000?
 * Text generator for burn-in and slate generation.
 * Software rendering / Mesa?
 
 djv_convert:
 
 * Convert entire directories of images.
 * Multiple outputs.
 
 djv_view:

 * A/B image comparison.
 * Automatically hide and show the menubar in fullscreen mode.
 * Add support for sequence handles.
 * More image analysis tools: waveform monitor, vector scope, legal colors.

 * Audio.
 * Playlists.
 * Layers.
 * Stereo.

 Bugs

 * Better handling of Windows drive letter mappings.
 * Nested scroll widget drawing artifacts.

 * Should image files be determined by extension or by inspecting the file
   header?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Doxygen Issues

 * Order isn't preserved for groups?
 * Namespace/using not supported?
 * Functions with the same name but in different namespaces sometimes get
   mixed-up comments. (e.g., global())
